# Bingo Caller App

## Description
Every year on New Year's Eve, my family and I have a tradition of playing Bingo together, and we would normally call numbers out using physical balls. Then I thought that I create a virtual version of the Bingo Caller App, where this would:
- Allow the caller to play.
- Show all called numbers to everyone seated to prevent questions about if the number has been called out previously or not.

I created this app using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Usage
Just open the webpage and click "Start".
Then click "Next" to call another number.
When all 75 numbers are called out, then clicking the next button would do nothing.
